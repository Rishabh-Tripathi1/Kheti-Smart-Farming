## Introduction

Kheti is a revolutionary project aimed at transforming agriculture in rural areas by leveraging cutting-edge technologies. Our mission is to empower farmers with data-driven insights and access to essential resources, ultimately improving crop yield, reducing risks, and increasing income.

## Features

### 1. Crop Recommendation
Kheti utilizes AI and ML algorithms to analyze soil quality, historical crop data, and local climate conditions to provide personalized crop recommendations. This helps farmers make informed decisions on what crops to cultivate, optimizing their yield.

### 2. Weather Forecasting
Accurate weather forecasting is essential for crop planning. Our platform integrates real-time weather data to provide farmers with up-to-date weather forecasts, helping them prepare for adverse conditions and make timely decisions.

### 3. Disease Detection
Early detection of crop diseases is crucial to prevent crop loss. Kheti employs image recognition and ML models to identify signs of diseases in crops, allowing farmers to take prompt action to control and mitigate the spread of diseases.

### 4. Fertilizer Suggestions
Proper fertilization is vital for healthy crop growth. Our system analyzes soil nutrient levels and crop types to offer customized fertilizer recommendations, ensuring efficient nutrient utilization and reducing waste.

### 5. Marketplace
Kheti includes a dedicated marketplace where farmers can buy and sell their produce, seeds, and agricultural equipment. This platform connects farmers with buyers and sellers in their region, promoting local trade and economic growth.
